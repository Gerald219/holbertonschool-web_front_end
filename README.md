# HTML Advanced

This project builds the structure of a full website using only HTML.
Each task adds new elements step by step until the page matches a complete design.

## What I learned
- How to structure a webpage correctly
- Using semantic tags (header, nav, section, article, footer)
- Building layouts with divs and containers
- Understanding hierarchy of headings
- Adding images, links, lists, tables, and icons
- Preparing clean and valid HTML for CSS styling

## Project structure
All tasks are inside the html_advanced/ folder.
Each file adds new parts of the Techium website.

## Requirements
- All files must be valid HTML5
- Use semantic structure
- No CSS or JavaScript in this part
- Use the correct doctype and <html lang="en" dir="ltr">

## How to run
Open html_advanced/0-index.html in your browser.
